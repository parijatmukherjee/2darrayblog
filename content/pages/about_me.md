Its great to see you here! ðŸ‘‹

According to my Google Analytics report, you're one of the rare, curious souls checking out this "About" page. Welcome to the club!

I'm Parijat Mukherjee, a tech enthusiast with over a decade of experience under my belt. Currently based in the vibrant city of Berlin, I spend my days navigating the ever-evolving tech landscape and my nights tinkering with the latest gadgets and innovations. Whether it's cracking a complex code or exploring the newest trends, I thrive on experimenting with technology and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

2darray is all about software, technology, and a bunch of cool configurations we use every day. As a developer, I know we can't possibly remember everything. So, I decided to use this blog as my personal notebook, hoping some of my notes will be useful for everyone else, too.

Starting to blog wasn't easy for me. The big question was, "What should I write about?" And to be honest, I was still asking myself that even when I began this blog. But here's the thing: everyone has something they're knowledgeable about that they can share through blogging.

If you like my blog and find it helpful, please let me know! You can email me at <parijat@2darray.com>. And feel free to reach out even just to say hi.

Digitally yours,

Parijat
