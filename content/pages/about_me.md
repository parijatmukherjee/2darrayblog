Its great to see you here! ðŸ‘‹

According to my Google Analytics report, you're one of the rare, curious souls checking out this "About" page. Welcome to the club!

2darray is all about software, technology, and a bunch of cool configurations we use every day. As a developer, I know we can't possibly remember everything. So, I decided to use this blog as my personal notebook, hoping some of my notes will be useful for everyone else, too.

Starting to blog wasn't easy for me. The big question was, "What should I write about?" And to be honest, I was still asking myself that even when I began this blog. But here's the thing: everyone has something they're knowledgeable about that they can share through blogging.

If you like my blog and find it helpful, please let me know! You can email me at <parijat@2darray.com>. And feel free to reach out just to say hi.

Digitally yours,

Parijat
